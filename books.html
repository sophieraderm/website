          Imagine a future in which everything is not free, but subscription-based. This includes Everything from schools to police and fire departments.
          Everything you require as a service must be purchased for a fixed fee. If you pay the fee, you get the service. If you don't, you don't.
          The world we live in is a world without governments, with the exception of shared resources and health care which still require some sort of governing body.
          If you're terminally ill and cannot afford health care, the government kicks in.<br>
          <br>
          It is a world where every school is a private school and there is no alternative other than to pay in order to attend it.
          A world of increased complexity in all facets of life, where things like roads and who gets to build what where is a significantly more complicated process. Traveling on roads requires micro-payments.<br>
          <br>
          We are about to experience a shift in our monetary system. What it looks like now is likely nothing like what it will look like after this shift has occurred.
          This book is written on the premise that we are heading towards a paradigm shift into a Subscription Society. The Subscription Society will greatly change the key forces that currently shape our monetary system as we know it, if not render
          it entirely obsolete.<br>
          <br>
          According to Roger Penrose, to act intelligently about something you first need to understand it, and in order to understand it you first need to be aware of it.
          Once you are aware of and understand something, you will be able to act on it should you choose to do so.
          This book is meant to help you with gaining an awareness of the forthcoming Subscription Society and understanding what it entails.<br>
          <br>
          Whether you choose to act on what you learn is up to you...<br>
